#<p>Created by Samuel F. Cabral, Andrew D. Pohl and Sandra Stark.</p>

#<h2>Elevator Pitch</h2>
#<p>App will provide information on US senators which is vital to creating accountability while in office.  </p>


#<h2>MVP</h2>
<p>Create a site which will render current Senators in the US Congress using GovTrack.us, New Tork Times Congress, and Sunlightlabs APIs. Users will be able to create accounts and save senators to "watch lists" to follow their careers.</p>

<p>Information for each Senator will include first and last name, birthday, gender, political party, job title, state they represent, senator rank, phone, start date, end date, website, govtrack link, twitter handle and YouTube id.</p>


#<h2>APIs Used</h2>
#<p>During the completion of this project we used three different APIs as well as three open source projects. The list of US Senators as well as basic information such as name, date of birth, party affiliation was gathered using the Govtrack.us API. Information regarding recently passed and recently introduced senate bills was gathered using the New York Times Congress API. We used the New York Times Campaign Finance API to gather information for the senators who managed to raise the most amount of money prior to the last election.</p>

#<p>We were able to pull photographs of each Senator by using the theunitedstates.io open source project which are rendered in each senator's biography page. We used 50states.com's database of state flags to render the flag of the state that each Senator represents. Finally, we used Jason Horsley's open project to render images of state maps for each Senator's state.</p>

#<h2>Technologies Used</h2>
#<p>For this project we used Ruby, Ruby on Rails, JavaScript and jQuery. Graphs rendered on the home page were created using charts.js.</p>
